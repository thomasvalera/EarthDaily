# Earth Daily
#### - Your daily dose of news from earth

This is a demo project meant to show the way I currently work, think and code.

## Project Structure
* News/Application  
Contains the main application and screens.
* News/Skeleton  
The skeleton of the application. Think of this as the project's framework, bases classes, helper classes, extensions, etc, that are not related to specific screens.
* NewsTests/Tests  
Straight forward... contains some tests.
* NewsTests/Mocks  
Contains mocks of the API services used by the application.
* NewsTests/Spies  
Spies uses to check if the right methods have been called during tests.
* ValionKit   
A small library containing UI related classes. The choice to add it in a separate library instead of the main project is to force reusability of views and make use of IBDesignables (although this project does not currently have any IBDesignables).

## Architecture
This project make use of the MVP + Navigator architecture. Following the MVP pattern, the navigator has been moved to its own class as it is not really a concern of neither the View nor the Presenter. Adding it as a separate entity in the pattern make for a better separation of concerns as the Model defines the data, the View displays the data and react to user inputs, the Presenter formats the model in order for the view to display it properly and the Navigator handles the overall navigation and flow of the application.

## API
This application is powered by NewsAPI.org, a simple and easy-to-use API that returns JSON metadata for headlines and articles live all over the web right now.
